Bugs and support
- fix bug with dock moving
- add command to install dependencies with pip to readme
- fix bug with strange drawing on some resolutions, e.g. 150x120 
- analize similar pieces of code and move this functionality to special methods
- write detailed guide with examples for all features
- add example of using choice_list with presets of ingame parameters and field configuration
- ? check if it works on mswindows and mac and fix if not

Not sure if need
- add default window icon and config key to add own
- buttons to save/load config - may be useful if many own parameters added
- think if it possible to make api even more simple and convenient
- ? method to adding own hbox'es
- ? active/inactive (blind) controls
