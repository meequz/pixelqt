Field and drawing
- fit size of window to field's size on start
- add centering in field on actions.start() and changing zoom
- fill the area around frame with grey color instead of white
- fullscreen mode, switching by double click in field, or with F11
- optimize draw if possible

Not sure
- ? method to adding own hbox'es
- ? buttons to save/load config - may be useful if many own parameters added
- ? active/inactive (blind) controls
- ? add default window icon and config key to add own
- ? 'save screen' button
- ? popup when incorrect values are set


Types of own game parameters:
	numbers: spinbox (start, finish, step)
	bool: checkbox
