General
- save images according to default config

Controls
- button for hide/show docks with controls and game params
- list with field presets
- add tooltips to all controls
- add keyboard shortcuts
- 'save screen' button

Field and drawing
- ? fullscreen mode, switching by double click in field, or with F11
- change zoom by mouse wheel in field
- optimize draw if possible

Bugs and support
- add command to install dependencies with pip to readme
- fix bug with strange drawing on some resolutions, e.g. 150x120 
- analize similar pieces of code and move this functionality to special methods
- write detailed guide with examples for all features
- port my color_pixels from pygame to pixelqt
- add example of using choice_list with presets of ingame parameters
- ? check if it works on mswindows and fix if not

Not sure if needed
- add default window icon and config key to add own
- buttons to save/load config - may be useful if many own parameters added
- think if it possible to make api more simple and convenient
- ? method to adding own hbox'es
- ? active/inactive (blind) controls
- ? popup when incorrect values are set

Own (in-game) parameters:
- make common 'set defaults' button
- make little 'set default' button on each own param, with arrow icon
- argument in add_own_* method to set tooltips to own parameters

Not understood how to make:
- action and control for draw text label over the top of saving image (name and frame number)
